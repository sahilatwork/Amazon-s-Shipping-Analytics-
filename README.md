# Amazon-s-Shipping-Analytics-
Amazon Shipping is a corporation that transports FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world. The Shipping Manager lacks visibility and has no idea how many orders are handled and sent on a monthly basis. This dashboard includes choices where he may choose a month and see how many orders are outstanding each day as well as where they should be dispatched. He has provided us with csv data from which we must develop a Dashboard for his rapid perusal in order for him to make additional decisions for the benefit of the organization. As a result, I designed the interactive dashboard shown below to meet his needs. He could now flip between different shipment statistics for different months and years.
